# Claude Code Setup project
Discuss options for setting up an environment for building with Claude Code.

# Brain storming
I want to build out a general purpose knowledge graph explorer.
- Fractal / hierarchal / nested / recursive / self-referential
- Perspective Maps
- Traversible / Ability to zoom in and out
- Multi-dimensional relationship types
- Visualizations
	- folder structure
	- word clouds
	- rooms (like a memory palace)

# First App: Claude Code project explorer
An app that allows a project to be visualized and explored from different perspectives using different views.

## Tech Risks
- Choose a programming language
- Choose a hosting environment
- Choose a development environment

## Bootstrap Strategy
Use markdown files organized into folders to explore concepts:
- Subject matter files
- Perspective maps
- Meta strategies

## More on Strategies
- Meta Strategies
- Composition and nesting of strategies
- Iterations
